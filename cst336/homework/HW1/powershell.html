                <p><b>Drilling Down Deeper: What is PowerShell?</b></p>
                <p>PowerShell is Microsoft's command-line and scripting framework built on the .NET platform. It lets administrators and developers interact directly with the operating system to handle tasks such as automation, configuration, and system management. Unlike older command-line tools that only handle plain text, PowerShell works with objects, meaning data is structured and can be filtered or passed between commands in powerful ways. This makes it not just a shell, but a complete automation environment that helps professionals control and manage systems efficiently at scale. Click below to learn more!</p>

                <p><b>Origin of PowerShell</b></p>
                <p>PowerShell is Microsoft's command-line and scripting tool made for administrators. It can run single commands, but it can also run full scripts. A big advantage of PowerShell is that it works with objects (not just text), so admins can filter and format data very easily. Click below to learn more!</p>

                <p><b>What is an API?</b></p>
                <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for one piece of software to talk to another. Many modern services such as Microsoft 365, cloud backups, device management tools, and HR systems expose web APIs so other programs or scripts can read or update data automatically.

                <p><b>Why They Are a Powerful Duo</b></p>
                <p>When an administrator combines PowerShell with APIs, they can automate across a network. A script can log into a cloud service, pull user information, compare it to Active Directory, and then make changes without risking the mistakes or sadness of the administrator.</p>
